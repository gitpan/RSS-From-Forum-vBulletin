DESCRIPTION
FUNCTIONS
    None are exported, but they are exportable.

  get_rss_from_forum(%args) -> [status, msg, result, meta]
    Generate an RSS page by parsing vBulletin forum display page.

    Many vBulletin forums do not turn on RSS feeds. This function parses
    vBulletin forum display page and create a simple RSS page so you can
    subscribe to it using RSS.

    Arguments ('*' denotes required arguments):

    *   ua => *obj*

        Supply a custom LWP::UserAgent object.

        If supplied, will be used instead of the default LWP::UserAgent
        object.

    *   url* => *str*

        Forum URL (the forum display page).

        Usually it's of the form: http://host/path/forumdisplay.php?f=XXX

    Return value:

    Returns an enveloped result (an array).

    First element (status) is an integer containing HTTP status code (200
    means OK, 4xx caller error, 5xx function error). Second element (msg) is
    a string containing error message, or 'OK' if status is 200. Third
    element (result) is optional, the actual result. Fourth element (meta)
    is called result metadata and is optional, a hash that contains extra
    information.

     (any)
